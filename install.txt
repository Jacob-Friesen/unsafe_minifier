Installation instructions built for a Debian based OS, though they should apply to most UNIX based OSs.

Steps:
1. Install Java (If you just want to view training data and data generation this is unnecessary)
2. Install node v0.8.2 (NOT the latest, there is a problem with the node fann bindings library)
    -I suggest using nvm (node version manager) to do this: https://github.com/creationix/nvm
		-DO NOT use npm to install packages, I have had to quickly modify libraries to iron out some of their bugs
3. Installing FANN (fast artificial nueral networks):
    -Install CMAKE so you can build FANN: http://www.cmake.org/
    -Install FANN: http://leenissen.dk/fann/wp/download/
        -Installation instructions here: http://leenissen.dk/fann/wp/help/installing-fann/
4. If running "node main.js" results in an error, run 'ldconfig' (exact command may vary based on OS)
4. If running "node main.js" still results in an error, you probably need to recompile the Node Fann bindings
		-install node-gyp globally (using npm: npm install -g node-gyp)
    -navigate to node_modules/node-fann
		-run: node-gyp configure
		-run: node-gyp build
